# carpet_motd_json
 
A very simple extension to [gnembon's fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) that took me 3 days to write. It makes it so that the server MOTD is parsed as JSON text, allowing for selector, translate, score, entity nbt, and storage nbt tags to be used in addition to the regular text components.
